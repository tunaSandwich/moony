# Budgeting Agent - Core Objectives

This project aims to build a lightweight AI assistant that helps users stay on track with their monthly budgets through simple, daily text-based guidance.

## Primary Goal
Deliver a daily spending recommendation to users based on their remaining budget and time left in the month - more complex calculation will come later.

## Core Objectives
- **User Budget Input**: Allow users to set or update their monthly budget.
- **Daily Spending Calculation**: Divide remaining budget by remaining days to generate a personalized spending limit.
- **Daily Messaging**: Send clear, concise text messages each morning with that day's suggested limit.
- **Simple Interaction Loop**: Optionally allow users to mark whether they stayed on track each day (for future improvements).
- **Minimal Initial Complexity**: Focus on core utility before adding advanced features like retrieval or personalization.

## Future Considerations
- Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support personalized financial advice.
- Build a lightweight feedback loop to help the agent adapt recommendations.
