I need you to create a comprehensive context transfer document that captures all the important progress, decisions, and context from our conversation. This will be passed to a new Claude conversation to maintain continuity.

Please create a structured report that includes:

- Today's date

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
- Core project description and objectives
- Key requirements and constraints (especially MVP focus)
- Target users and use cases

**TECHNICAL DECISIONS & ARCHITECTURE**
- API design decisions we've made
- Database schema or data model decisions
- Technology stack choices and rationale
- Architecture patterns we've chosen

**DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS & TRADE-OFFS**
- Key design principles we've established
- Trade-offs we've discussed and resolved
- Rejected approaches and why
- Open questions or decisions still pending

**CURRENT STATE**
- What we've completed or decided
- Current blockers or challenges
- Next steps or priorities identified

**COLLABORATION PREFERENCES**
- Types of questions or clarifications that have been most helpful
- Communication style preferences I've expressed
- Level of detail I prefer in responses
- How I like to work through problems

Format this as a clear, well-organized document that another Claude instance can quickly absorb to understand both the technical context and how to best collaborate with me going forward.
